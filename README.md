# Embedded-System-that-detects-an-object
This is a school project of the course EE447. By using TM4C123GH6PM, I build a system that can detect an object within 1 meter and print its angle and distance.

At the zip file, all necessary files and the project file that can be opened by keil is present. Also the pin connections and the general flow of the code is explained in the project report file.
